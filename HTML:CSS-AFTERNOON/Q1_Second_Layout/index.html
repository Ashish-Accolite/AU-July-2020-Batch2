            <p class="label-style"><b>C</b>hris Christie noticed a piece in the New York Times – that’s how it all started. The New Jersey governor had dropped out of the presidential race 
                in February 2016 and thrown what support he had behind Donald Trump. In late April, he saw the article. 
                It described meetings between representatives of the remaining candidates still in the race – Trump, John Kasich, Ted Cruz,
                 Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders – and the Obama White House. Anyone who still had any kind of shot at becoming president of 
                 the United States apparently needed to start preparing to run the federal government. The guy Trump sent to the meeting was, 
                 in Christie’s estimation, comically underqualified. Christie called up Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, to ask why 
                 this critical job had not been handed to someone who actually knew something about government. “We don’t have anyone,” said 
                 Lewandowski.</p>

                            the world we live in, largely because of disruptions from bad transitions,” he said. “People don’t understand that a bungled 
                            transition becomes a bungled presidency.” The new people taking over the job of running the government were at best only partially
